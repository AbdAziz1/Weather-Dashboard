## 🎯 Key Features
- 📊 **Interactive Visuals** – Dynamic charts and graphs for temperature, humidity, and wind speed analysis.
- 📅 **Time-Series Analysis** – Identify seasonal patterns and daily/weekly weather fluctuations.
- 🗺️ **Geographic Insights** – Weather conditions visualized across locations.
- ⚡ **KPIs & Metrics** – Highlighting maximum, minimum, and average values.
- 🔍 **Filtering & Slicing** – Drill down by date, location, or weather parameter.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling, visualization, and report building  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures and calculations  
- **Data Model** – Relationships between weather parameters and time dimensions  

---

## 📑 Dataset Details
The dashboard uses **real-world weather data** fetched from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) (free tier API).  
The dataset was collected programmatically and then modeled in Power BI.  

### Fields Collected
- **Date / Time** – timestamp of the weather record  
- **Location / City / Region** – geographic dimension for analysis  
- **Temperature** – daily minimum, maximum, and average  
- **Humidity (%)** – atmospheric moisture level  
- **Wind Speed (km/h or mph)** – wind velocity  
- **Wind Direction** – compass direction of wind flow  
- **Precipitation (mm)** – rainfall measurement  
- **Weather Condition** – descriptive category (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)  



### 💡 Key Learnings

* Building interactive reports in Power BI
* Designing effective data models and relationships
* Applying DAX measures for advanced insights
* Presenting data with clear storytelling visuals
